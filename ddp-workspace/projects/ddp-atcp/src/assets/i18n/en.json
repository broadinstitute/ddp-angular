      "Text": "is an inherited, neurodegenerative disease. A child with A-T begins to suffer\nfrom\nprogressive loss of muscle control around the age of two years. By the age of nine or ten, children with A-T\nusually become dependent on wheelchairs and their speech becomes slurred. Reading and swallowing also become\ndifficult. About 30 percent of A-T children develop cancer, and most of them have some degree of immune system\nproblems. Although progress has been made in extending the lives of people with A-T through managing their\nsymptoms, the disease remains relentless.",

    "SecondParagraph": {
      "TextOne": "Siblings with A-T seem to share more similar clinical features than A-T children who carry the same mutations but belong to different families. Scientists therefore believe that a family’s genes – other than the one the causes A-T – may change how A-T affects patients. In addition, it is possible that living in different environments, engaging in different lifestyles and eating a different diet may impact the health of people with A-T.",
      "TextSecond": "We recently identified several people who have typical, disease-causing mutations in their A-T genes, and make no\nA-T protein (just as other people with A-T), and yet their A-T symptoms are astonishingly mild. We are now\noptimistic that we might be able to find changes in other genes that correct or compensate for the A-T mutations\nin these 'super-mild' patients. If so, researchers could possibly find new drug treatments to help all people with\nA-T. But first, we need to gather the clinical and genetic data from as many people with A-T as possible.",
      "TextThird": "Similarly, by comparing the medical histories and lifestyles of different A-T patients, researchers may learn\nwhich symptom management strategies produce better health outcomes. But first, we need to obtain and combine data\nfrom many A-T patients in one place.",
