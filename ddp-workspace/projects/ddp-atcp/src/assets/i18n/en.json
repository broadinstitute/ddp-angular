It is hoped that the members of this advisory board will not only include experts in the clinical presentation and underlying biology of ataxia-telangiectasia but also experts in the analysis of large datasets such as genome sequence data, biostatistics, application programming interfaces, data security, regulatory issues, medical ethics, legal matters, and surveying methodologies.

      "Title": "Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T)",
      "Text": "is an inherited, neurodegenerative disease. A child with A-T begins to suffer\nfrom\nprogressive loss of muscle control around the age of two years. By the age of nine or ten, children with A-T\nusually become dependent on wheelchairs and their speech becomes slurred. Reading and swallowing also become\ndifficult. About 30 percent of A-T children develop cancer, and most of them have some degree of immune system\nproblems. Although progress has been made in extending the lives of people with A-T through managing their\nsymptoms, the disease remains relentless."
    },
    "SecondParagraph": {
      "Title": "A-T affects everyone in a different way",
      "TextOne": "Siblings with A-T seem to share more similar clinical features than A-T children who carry the same mutations but belong to different families. Scientists therefore believe that a family’s genes – other than the one the causes A-T – may change how A-T affects patients. In addition, it is possible that living in different environments, engaging in different lifestyles and eating a different diet may impact the health of people with A-T.",
      "TextSecond": "We recently identified several people who have typical, disease-causing mutations in their A-T genes, and make no\nA-T protein (just as other people with A-T), and yet their A-T symptoms are astonishingly mild. We are now\noptimistic that we might be able to find changes in other genes that correct or compensate for the A-T mutations\nin these 'super-mild' patients. If so, researchers could possibly find new drug treatments to help all people with\nA-T. But first, we need to gather the clinical and genetic data from as many people with A-T as possible.",
      "TextThird": "Similarly, by comparing the medical histories and lifestyles of different A-T patients, researchers may learn\nwhich symptom management strategies produce better health outcomes. But first, we need to obtain and combine data\nfrom many A-T patients in one place."
