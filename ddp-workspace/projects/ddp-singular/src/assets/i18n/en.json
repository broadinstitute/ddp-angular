It will also help us learn how these defects may lead to other health problems.",

In some people, one ventricle doesn’t grow fully. That ventricle may be smaller. Or it may not develop all the way. Or it may be missing an important piece. When any of these things happen it is called a single ventricle heart defect.",

The most common are:</b></p><ul class=\"simple-list\"><li>Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS)</li><li>Tricuspid Atresia</li><li>Double Inlet Left Ventricle (DILV)</li><li>Double Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV)</li><li>Single Left Ventricle</li><li>Pulmonary Atresia with Intact Ventricular<br /> Septum (PA-IVS)</li><li>Unbalanced Atrioventricular Canal</li></ul>",

But some patients end up with other health problems after surgery.",

Sometimes the person’s single ventricle can fail.  The best option right now for a failing single ventricle is a heart transplant. But there are a lot of people who need a heart transplant.
