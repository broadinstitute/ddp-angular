Circadian rhythms are an integral part of our functioning, regulating and syncing our human behavior and physiology with the external environment and the 24-hour day. While research has been able to identify core components of our molecular circadian clock, much is still unknown about the genetics and physiological mechanisms driving our circadian rhythms."

There is also an optional blood draw that can be scheduled if you are local to the New England region and are interested in providing the blood draw.</p>"

However, we will return your dim light melatonin onset results and your food logging in the form of a report. These will provide you with insight into your natural bedtime, sleep habits, morning/evening preference, and diet. You will also receive updates on the study via a newsletter. You will help contribute to research within an understudied population. We hope this study will help us better understand atypical circadian rhythms. Specifically, whether there are changes in genes. These changes in genes may be linked or lead to atypical circadian rhythms. This knowledge may help us find therapies and better diagnostics for atypical circadian rhythms.</p><p class=\"faq-paragraph\">The risks associated with this study are minimal and can include: sleep loss, gum sensitivity, skin irritation from wearable technology, side effects due to refraining from certain substances (alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, recreational drugs, certain foods, and/or melatonin), loss of confidentiality, and risks from the optional blood draw.</p>"

We will provide a smartphone on which you will access our online portal and complete your sleep and food logs. The smartphone will be the main source of study communication during the at-home portion of the study. Prior to receiving the at-home kit, which includes the study smartphone, you will need to complete the screening questionnaires, consent and enrollment, and some study tasks from your own electronic device. This will require you having access to either data or Wi-fi sources, and access to a web browser, to access the study website, materials, and tasks. You will NOT need to download any applications onto your own personal device. Once you have received the at-home study kit, we will ask you to use the study smartphone to complete study tasks. You will need access to local wi-fi networks to use the study smartphone.</p><p class=\"faq-paragraph\">We recognize that not everyone has access to a reliable wi-fi source, or personal electronic device.

The questionnaires and dim light saliva collection provide us with background information about your lifestyle and give context to your DNA sample.</p><p class=\"faq-paragraph\">You will be assigned a study number and your data will be coded with this number.
