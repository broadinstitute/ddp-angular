      "Title": "About the Study",
      "Paragraph": "The Circadia research study is focused on better understanding the genetics of circadian rhythm disorders. Circadian rhythms are an integral part of our functioning, regulating and syncing our human behavior and physiology with the external environment and the 24-hour day. While research has been able to identify core components of our molecular circadian clock, much is still unknown about the genetics and physiological mechanisms driving our circadian rhythms."
