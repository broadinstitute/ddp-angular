The goal of Count Me In is to transform cancer care by enabling all cancer patients to accelerate biomedical research through sharing their cancer samples, clinical information, and their experiences. This partnership generates cancer datasets containing linked clinical, genomic, molecular, and patient-reported data without including any personal information. In order to accelerate the pace at which discoveries are made, Count Me In data is regularly shared with the biomedical research community through scientific repositories such as cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genomic Data Commons.",

There is tremendous scientific value in studying this large, cross-cutting group of patients who represent many different cancer types, treating institutions, and ages or other demographics. The more that participants in research truly represent the full diversity of cancer patients and their experiences, the greater the impact that scientific discoveries can have for everyone.",
                        "Additional biological samples, such as tumor samples, blood samples, and stool samples, will be obtained from specific patient cohorts and used to generate genomic and molecular data for analysis. This resulting data will be linked to the genomic data from saliva samples, the clinical information from medical records, and patient-reported information from surveys, which will be shared with the biomedical research community. By integrating all of these different and important aspects of cancer, resulting Count Me In datasets will accelerate research discoveries across many different fields."

Patients’ medical records, tumor samples, and personal experiences hold clues—about which cancers will respond or become resistant to which therapies — that often can’t be found in research labs or clinical trials. <br/>The majority of patients have never had the opportunity to participate in research—because most cancer patients are cared for in community settings where this type of research is not done; most patients have never been asked if they’d like to contribute their tissue samples and medical information for research. <br/>Answering many important questions about cancer will require engaging and empowering many more patients as partners, and offering the opportunity to participate in groundbreaking research to all people living with cancer, whether they live near a research hospital or not. Count Me In aims to help make that possible."
