The Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) project was the first iteration of this new vision, followed by the Angiosarcoma (ASC) Project in 2017, and the Metastatic Prostate Cancer (MPC) Project in 2018. Since then, CMI has also launched the Esophageal and Stomach Cancer Project, the Osteosarcoma (OS) Project, and the Brain Tumor (BT) Project.

With patient consent, all data collected by and generated through Count Me In are shared regularly with the research community (after being stripped of identifying information) through freely available scientific databases, so researchers anywhere can help rapidly accelerate the pace of discovery, expand our understanding of cancer, and develop new treatment strategies – breaking down silos that exist in cancer research."

Patients’ medical records, tumor samples, and personal experiences hold clues—about which cancers will respond or become resistant to which therapies—that often can’t be found in research labs or clinical trials. \nThe majority of patients have never had the opportunity to participate in research—because most cancer patients are cared for in community settings where this type of research is not done; most patients have never been asked if they’d like to contribute their tissue samples and medical information for research.\nAnswering many important questions about cancer will require engaging and empowering many more patients as partners, and offering the opportunity to participate in groundbreaking research to all people living with cancer, whether they live near a research hospital or not. Count Me In aims to help make that possible."

Cancer disparities exist as evidence of how much more work in this space needs to be done - and it’s one in which we recognize that we’ll never truly arrive - but continue to strive for, alongside patients. We believe patients should be direct partners in cancer research and know that we can only advance our understanding of cancer and accelerate discoveries, if we do so together."
