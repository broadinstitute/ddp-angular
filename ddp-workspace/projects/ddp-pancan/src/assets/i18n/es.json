This partnership generates cancer datasets containing linked clinical, genomic, molecular, and patient-reported data without including any personal information. In order to accelerate the pace at which discoveries are made, Count Me In data is regularly shared with the biomedical research community through scientific repositories such as cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genomic Data Commons.",

There is tremendous scientific value in studying this large, cross-cutting group of patients who represent many different cancer types, treating institutions, and ages or other demographics. The more that participants in research truly represent the full diversity of cancer patients and their experiences, the greater the impact that scientific discoveries can have for everyone.",

This resulting data will be linked to the genomic data from saliva samples, the clinical information from medical records, and patient-reported information from surveys, which will be shared with the biomedical research community. By integrating all of these different and important aspects of cancer, resulting Count Me In datasets will accelerate research discoveries across many different fields.",

Count Me In has built and will continue to build research initiatives around different patient populations and cohorts. As more people join, there will be more opportunities to launch deeper studies within more patient cohorts."

Since then, CMI has also launched the Esophageal and Stomach Cancer Project, the Osteosarcoma (OS) Project, and the Brain Tumor (BT) Project.

Count Me In is committed to the core principle that every cancer patient, regardless of where they live, what language they speak, what their heritage may be - that their experience matters and the inclusion of their experience is imperative in furthering our understanding of cancer.",
                        "Traditional cancer research does not lend itself to being as inclusive as it should be. Cancer disparities exist as evidence of how much more work in this space needs to be done - and it’s one in which we recognize that we’ll never truly arrive - but continue to strive for, alongside patients. We believe patients should be direct partners in cancer research and know that we can only advance our understanding of cancer and accelerate discoveries, if we do so together."
