This partnership generates cancer datasets containing linked clinical, genomic, molecular, and patient-reported data without including any personal information.

Count Me In is committed to the core principle that every cancer patient, regardless of where they live, what language they speak, what their heritage may be - that their experience matters and the inclusion of their experience is imperative in furthering our understanding of cancer.",
                    "Section2": "[es]Traditional cancer research does not lend itself to being as inclusive as it should be. Cancer disparities exist as evidence of how much more work in this space needs to be done - and it’s one in which we recognize that we’ll never truly arrive - but continue to strive for, alongside patients. We believe patients should be direct partners in cancer research and know that we can only advance our understanding of cancer and accelerate discoveries, if we do so together."
