Potential volunteers first have a phone conversation with the study team to answer any questions, confirm eligibility, and collect some baseline information. For eligible individuals who decide to participate, the study involves annual visits to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA, with an interval between visits of 9-12 months. The study visits would include the following components, performed over 1.5 days: routine physical exam, health questionnaires, lumbar puncture, blood draw, brain imaging scans, cognitive tests, gait analysis. Eligible participants will receive compensation and financial assistance with travel costs. All participation is strictly voluntary.",

A secondary goal of this study is to learn more about how CJD and other rapid neurological conditions progress by studying these diseases in each patient over time. Because CJD is a rare condition and very rapidly progressive, diagnosis of the disease is often made very late in the illness. If any future treatments for CJD are to be successful, they likely will need to be given to patients as early as possible, before the disease progresses too far. It is therefore important that we learn how to make an accurate diagnosis earlier.",

Therapies for prion diseases are currently under development, but in order to prepare for these trials, it is necessary to identify markers sensitive to biological changes in early disease stages, when symptoms have not yet developed (i.e, presymptomatic phase).
