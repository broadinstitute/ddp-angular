But prion disease is rare -- it only affects about 1 in 5,000 people in their lifetimes -- so it can be hard to find enough patients to make research possible. This registry allows people affected by, or at risk for, prion disease, to connect with doctors and scientists interested in recruiting for research studies."

We believe that a therapy for prion disease is possible in our lifetimes. Scientists are working hard on making this a reality, but studying cells and mice can only get us so far.
