Now with over 2300 members the group is Stronger and Dedicated to support and knowledge sharing. Mary Anne knows Knowledge is Power! She shares a tool kit of survival skills and options like using cognitive abilities to cope, reminding ourselves to stay grounded and be grateful.<br><br>It’s hard to believe that she just recently survived a bout with covid making this her second epidemic in my 73 years!

She believes that patient-researcher collaboration is key to accelerating rare cancer research and improving patient experiences and outcomes. She has found support, education, and hope through her participation in online communities and conversations, especially as a member of Leiomyosarcoma Support & Direct Research Foundation (LMSDR), and also as a learner in conversation on social media with doctors, researchers, and advanced cancer patients. Stacey is the daughter of a father who lived just 11 weeks beyond a diagnosis of angiosarcoma of the small bowel and a mother who lived 19 years beyond a stage 4 melanoma diagnosis. As such, she has witnessed the devastating limits of current medical knowledge–and the possibilities that exist beyond those limits.

In order to achieve these goals, datasets containing linked clinical, genomic, molecular, and patient-reported data (without including any personal information) will be regularly shared with the biomedical research community through scientific repositories such as cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genomic Data Commons.",

We will ask pathology departments to share only a part of tumor tissue, and not to share anything with us that might be needed for clinical care.",

Most patients are cared for in community settings where genomic studies are not\ntypically conducted, so this study connects leiomyosarcoma patients around the country with\ngenomics research performed at the Broad Institute, allowing them to participate regardless of\nwhere they live. The study was designed in partnership with leiomyosarcoma patients, families,\nadvocates, and advocacy groups, who continue to provide input on future directions.",

The database\nof clinically annotated genomic information is shared on publicly available platforms such as\ncBioPortal and the NIH.",
