Since 2013 he has been on the Board of Directors of the National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation that is committed to patient education and support and the funding of Leiomyosarcoma specific research.  With his wife Annie in 2018, he helped to establish the NLMSF-SPAEN International LMS Research Roundtable composed of basic science sarcoma researchers, research medical and surgical sarcomas oncologists from Canada, Europe, Japan and the United States whose mission is to do research to better understand the basic science of LMS with the aim of developing novel more effective treatments for this rare cancer.  Currently, there are 120 Roundtable members.  Mitch is a member of several cancer and sarcoma organizations including the American Society of Clinical Oncology), the American Association of Cancer Research, the Connective Tissue Oncology Society, and the European Society for Medical Oncology and is a patient advocate for the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group and its Sarcoma Working Group.

She has been living with stage 4 leiomyosarcoma for five years. Since her diagnosis, she has been on an odyssey of self-education, becoming a voracious reader of medical research, a ferocious self-advocate, and a passionate, vocal proponent of patient empowerment. She believes that patient-researcher collaboration is key to accelerating rare cancer research and improving patient experiences and outcomes. She has found support, education, and hope through her participation in online communities and conversations, especially as a member of Leiomyosarcoma Support & Direct Research Foundation (LMSDR), and also as a learner in conversation on social media with doctors, researchers, and advanced cancer patients. Stacey is the daughter of a father who lived just 11 weeks beyond a diagnosis of angiosarcoma of the small bowel and a mother who lived 19 years beyond a stage 4 melanoma diagnosis. As such, she has witnessed the devastating limits of current medical knowledge–and the possibilities that exist beyond those limits. She is counting on the power of patient-physician-researcher partnership to propel us towards a hopeful future.\n"

Most patients are cared for in community settings where genomic studies are not\ntypically conducted, so this study connects leiomyosarcoma patients around the country with\ngenomics research performed at the Broad Institute, allowing them to participate regardless of\nwhere they live. The study was designed in partnership with leiomyosarcoma patients, families,\nadvocates, and advocacy groups, who continue to provide input on future directions.",

      "paragraphText7": "Next generation sequencing (whole exome and transcriptome sequencing) is performed on\ntumor and germline DNA. Sequencing data are linked to de-identified clinical information, and\nthe resulting data are used to identify drivers of tumorigenesis, mechanisms of response and\nresistance to therapies, and diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers. The database\nof clinically annotated genomic information is shared on publicly available platforms such as\ncBioPortal and the NIH.",

      "paragraphText8": "Over the past decade, genomic characterization of tumors has shed enormous light on the\nmolecular underpinnings of cancer. These discoveries have led to the development of novel\ntherapies and preventive measures that have already revolutionized cancer care. Despite this\nprogress, the genomics of leiomyosarcoma remains poorly understood.",
