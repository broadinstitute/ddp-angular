She learned about advocacy by her parents who got her the best medical care at Boston Children’s Hospital. Thankfully she survived.\n\nThis cancer diagnosis shocked her, but she knew she had to educate herself about this Leiomyosarcoma. Her search led her to Dana Farber Cancer Institute where her top notch Medical Team has guided her to understand this rare cancer. ULMS now stage IV with lung and bone metastasis has taught her to maneuver the battle of a lifetime.\n\nEarly on in 2014-2015 she founded the Sarcoma Sunflower Brigade, a Facebook Support Group with four members. Now with over 2300 members the group is Stronger and Dedicated to support and knowledge sharing. Mary Anne knows Knowledge is Power! She shares a tool kit of survival skills and options like using cognitive abilities to cope, reminding ourselves to stay grounded and be grateful.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that she just recently survived a bout with covid making this her second epidemic in my 73 years! It’s more important to stay connected during this troublesome lonely time. Her two amazing sons and five precious grandchildren are her world. She stays in treatment and believes that through her resilience she is surviving and able to share hope. We are Stronger Together.\n",

Since 2013 he has been on the Board of Directors of the National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation that is committed to patient education and support and the funding of Leiomyosarcoma specific research.  With his wife Annie in 2018, he helped to establish the NLMSF-SPAEN International LMS Research Roundtable composed of basic science sarcoma researchers, research medical and surgical sarcomas oncologists from Canada, Europe, Japan and the United States whose mission is to do research to better understand the basic science of LMS with the aim of developing novel more effective treatments for this rare cancer.  Currently, there are 120 Roundtable members.  Mitch is a member of several cancer and sarcoma organizations including the American Society of Clinical Oncology), the American Association of Cancer Research, the Connective Tissue Oncology Society,`F and the European Society for Medical Oncology and is a patient advocate for the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group and its Sarcoma Working Group.

She has been living with stage 4 leiomyosarcoma for five years. Since her diagnosis, she has been on an odyssey of self-education, becoming a voracious reader of medical research, a ferocious self-advocate, and a passionate, vocal proponent of patient empowerment. She believes that patient-researcher collaboration is key to accelerating rare cancer research and improving patient experiences and outcomes. She has found support, education, and hope through her participation in online communities and conversations, especially as a member of Leiomyosarcoma Support & Direct Research Foundation (LMSDR), and also as a learner in conversation on social media with doctors, researchers, and advanced cancer patients. Stacey is the daughter of a father who lived just 11 weeks beyond a diagnosis of angiosarcoma of the small bowel and a mother who lived 19 years beyond a stage 4 melanoma diagnosis. As such, she has witnessed the devastating limits of current medical knowledge–and the possibilities that exist beyond those limits. She is counting on the power of patient-physician-researcher partnership to propel us towards a hopeful future.\n",
