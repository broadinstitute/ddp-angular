          "Descriptions": [
            "Brugada syndrome is a condition characterized by abnormalities in the electrical activity of the heart. Individuals are usually diagnosed with Brugada syndrome due to a specific pattern seen on the electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), a test that records electrical activity of the heart.",
            "While some people with Brugada syndrome will not show any signs or symptoms, individuals with Brugada syndrome are at risk for having irregular heartbeats that, if left untreated, can cause fainting episodes, cardiac arrest, or sudden death. Therefore, it is important to recognize who is at-risk for Brugada syndrome to help prevent sudden death.",
            "Brugada syndrome can be inherited. Brugada syndrome can be caused by changes (called “variants” or “mutations”) in genes that can be passed down in families from generation to generation. However, the genetic variants that cause Brugada syndrome cannot be found in most individuals, because we do not know which genes to look for or how to interpret all of the variation in the human genome.",
            "We expect that researching the DNA of individuals with Brugada syndrome will help us learn which genetic variants cause Brugada syndrome. This may allow us to better identify individuals at risk for Brugada syndrome, and develop treatments specific for the condition.",
            "Inherited heart conditions like Brugada syndrome are an important cause of sudden death. These conditions are individually rare, making them difficult to study. We would therefore like to enable individuals with Brugada syndrome to contribute to research to help us move the science forward. Ultimately, we hope to advance our understanding of the genetic basis of Brugada syndrome, and other inherited heart conditions, by connecting the data of patients together."
