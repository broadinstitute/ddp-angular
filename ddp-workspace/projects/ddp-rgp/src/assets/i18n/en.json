The Broad Institute conducts genomic sequencing and research for many projects, and has sequenced over 200,000 human genomes and 500,000 human exomes to date. One of the projects, led by Drs. Heidi Rehm and Daniel MacArthur in collaboration with other researchers, has led to the diagnosis of over 2,000 families with rare disease through genomic sequencing. In 2017, Drs. Rehm and MacArthur created the Rare Genomes Project to bring these resources directly to families."
