      <p class="Subheading" i18n>What is the goal of The Rare Genomes Project?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>The goal of the Rare Genomes Project is to discover the genes underlying undiagnosed
        rare, genetic conditions by providing families affected by rare disease access to whole genomic sequencing.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>What does "undiagnosed" mean?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>For our project, we use this term to mean “<span class="Accent" i18n>genetically</span>
        undiagnosed.” Genetically undiagnosed patients do not have a genetic change(s) identified that explains
        their symptoms. These patients may or may not have a <span class="Accent" i18n>clinical diagnosis</span>, which
        is based on symptoms and other types of medical test results.</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>For example, individuals are most often diagnosed with cystic fibrosis based on
        physical symptoms and a sweat test. This is a <span class="Accent" i18n>clinical diagnosis</span>. Having
        genetic testing that identifies two variants in the <span class="Italic">CFTR</span> gene that cause cystic
        fibrosis is a <span class="Accent" i18n>genetic diagnosis</span>.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>Who is conducting the research?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>The Rare Genomes Project was launched at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard by
        researchers Daniel MacArthur, PhD and Heidi Rehm, PhD. We are also working in collaboration with Monkol Lek,
        PhD from Yale University, Eric Liao, MD from Massachusetts General Hospital, Carsten Bonnemann, MD from NIH,
        and the Lab for Molecular Medicine at Partners HealthCare Center for Personalized Medicine.</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>Our team is made up of researchers, physicians, software developers,
        genetic counselors, and study coordinators. Learn more about us

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>Do I have to travel to the Rare Genomes Project office in Massachusetts to
        participate?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>No. Participation is entirely remote.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>Are there any costs to participate?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>There are no costs to you to participate in this study. Everything you need to
        participate, including the cost of sample collection, genomic sequencing, and clinical confirmation genetic
        testing, will be covered by us.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>Will I receive medical care and/or treatment from the Rare Genomes Project?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>No. Medical care and treatment will not be provided as part of this research study.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>What role does my medical provider play in this study?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>While we do not require involvement in the application process, a family's clinician
        can help individuals identify pertinent medical records and is also critical in partnering with us to
        clinically confirm and return results to families.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>What type of sample will I be asked for?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>We request one small tube of blood. In rare cases, we have worked with families to
        explore alternative sample types.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>What type of genetic testing is performed by the Rare Genomes Project offering?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>The Rare Genomes Project offers Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). WGS is a different
        test than Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), which is a more focused test that is more commonly covered by
        insurance companies. Sometimes, we may perform additional tests including Structural Variant Analysis and
        RNAseq. To learn more about WGS and other types of genetic testing, we recommend reading through Genetics
        Home Reference's <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer#testing" target="_blank" class="Link" i18n>website</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>I have already had whole genome sequencing. Will the Rare Genomes Project accept my
        external data for reanalysis?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>On a case-by-case basis. If you have had prior genomic sequencing, fill out an
        application to our study and indicate that you have prior sequencing data available. If your application is
        accepted, we will reach out to you and discuss the next steps. Due to the resources involved in obtaining and
        manipulating data from other sources, it is sometimes more time and cost effective for us to sequence your
        genome again.</p>

      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>Patients and families with rare, suspected genetic disease. To see if the
        Rare Genomes Project might be appropriate for your family, visit our
        <a href [routerLink]="['/eligibility-criteria']" class="Link" i18n>Eligibility Criteria</a> page for
        more detailed information.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>Can I apply if I live outside the United States?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>We currently are only able to enroll individuals that live in the United States.
        However, we hope to eventually expand the project. If you live outside the United States and are interested
        in participating, we encourage you to indicate on our
        <a href [routerLink]="['/count-me-in']" class="Link" i18n>application page</a> that you do not live in the
        United States and then join our mailing list on the following page when prompted. We will contact you if we
        change our participation requirements in the future.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>Who in my family should participate?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>The nature of this project requires that the person in your family with an
        undiagnosed genetic condition participate. Although not a requirement, having additional family members
        participate, especially both of the patient's biological parents and additional affected family members,
        improves our chances of finding the genetic cause of the rare, undiagnosed condition. For example, a study of
        whole exome sequencing showed that analysis of parents along with affected children increased the likelihood
        of diagnosis from 22% to 31% (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1918775"
          target="_blank" class="Link" i18n>Lee et al. 2014</a>).</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>Can I still apply to the Rare Genomes Project if the affected family member is
        adopted, or one biological parent is unavailable?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>Yes. In cases where one biological parent is unavailable, we may ask about the
        availability of their other relatives.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>If I complete an application, will I automatically be able to participate?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>No. Our clinical team reviews each application to determine whether the
        individual or family is a good fit for this study. In some cases, we may need to review your medical records
        in order to make a determination. To learn more, visit our
        <a href [routerLink]="['/eligibility-criteria']" class="Link" i18n>Eligibility Criteria</a> page.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>Why was my application to the Rare Genomes Project not accepted?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>There are many reasons an application may not be accepted. Some reasons include: the
        condition is not likely to be caused by a change in a single gene, the approach taken by our study is not
        likely to diagnose the condition in question, or we believe a genetic diagnosis has already been identified.

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>How and where do I get my blood drawn?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>We will mail you a pre-paid specimen collection kit for you to have your blood drawn
        at a location of your choosing. We have partnered with Quest Diagnostics, a company with
        <a href="https://appointment.questdiagnostics.com/patient/confirmation" target="_blank" class="Link"
          i18n>thousands of blood draw locations</a> across the United States and Puerto Rico, who will draw blood
        for the study and bill us directly. Alternatively, you can have your blood drawn by a local provider. If
        you are billed for this, send us a receipt for reimbursement.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>What happens after I return my blood kit?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>After your kit returns to our facilities, we will extract DNA from your blood sample
        and prepare it for DNA sequencing or targeted testing.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>Who in my family will get their genome sequenced?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>It depends. Typically, we perform genome sequencing on the affected individual(s) in
        the family and their biological parents (when available). We typically only perform targeted testing for
        specific variants of interest in unaffected family members.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>What else might I be asked to share if I participate in this project?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>We require medical records from the affected family member(s). We may also inquire
        about the availability of excess tissue from clinical procedures for additional testing. Because this study
        does not include a physical examination by study staff, we will also ask participants to share a photograph;
        this is optional.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>Why am I being asked for photographs?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>We routinely ask for photographs of the member of the family with the undiagnosed
        condition. Some genetic syndromes are known to cause characteristic or subtle facial features that we consider
        when determining if a participant’s condition is related to a genetic variant. Photographs are considered
        part of the patient’s medical record and will not be shared externally without permission.</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>When should I update study staff?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>It is important to contact us if you change your contact information (such as phone
        number or address) or have new medical information you wish to add to your file (such as a new symptom, a
        genetic diagnosis from another source, or the development of the condition in other family members.)</p>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>Can I withdraw from the project?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>Yes, you can withdraw from the project at any time. If you do, your samples and your
        information will be destroyed. However, it will not be possible to destroy samples and information that have
        already been shared with other researchers. If you decide to withdraw your permission, you should contact us
        in writing at <a href="mailto:raregenomes@broadinstitute.org" class="Link" target="_blank" i18n>

      <p class="Subheading" i18n>Can I have access to my genetic sequencing data?</p>
      <p class="Paragraph" i18n>Unfortunately, no. Because the genomic sequencing in this study will be performed in
