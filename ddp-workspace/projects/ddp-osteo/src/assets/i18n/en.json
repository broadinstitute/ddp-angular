Daniel had a smile that would light up a room, and all throughout treatment, he never quit smiling. While Daniel was on hospice, Theresa taught herself genomics and started doing research into osteosarcoma genetics. She was able to identify two drugs which corresponded to mutations in Daniel’s tumor and prolonged his life. Since Daniel’s death on August 28, 2016, she has continued her patient advocacy and genomics research and is the Principal Investigator of POWR, the Patient/parent Osteosarcoma genome-Wide Registry, believed to be one of the largest genomic and medical history registry of osteosarcoma data in the world. She has presented her research findings at numerous scientific conferences in the US and internationally, and has been invited to speak at a variety of forums. A TV long-story on Daniel and her work won the prestigious National 2018 June L. Biedler Award for TV journalism. In 2019, she started a closed Facebook group called the Osteosarcoma Information Group to provide scientific and medical information and explanations to osteosarcoma patients and their families. Today, there are well over 500 members and doctors and researchers are now joining the group as well. She is the founder and President of “Because of Daniel '', a charitable foundation dedicated to osteosarcoma research and clinical trials. She is also a co-founder and board member of the Osteosarcoma Collaborative, a charitable foundation dedicated to promoting collaboration in osteosarcoma. In her day job, Theresa is a space engineer (aka rocket scientist) for NASA.",

She knew there had to be a way to Make It Better. She began MIB Agents, a nationwide 501c3 non-profit and the FACTOR Conference.

It was here that she met some of the most incredible children who never let their illness stand in their way. She watched them bravely battle Osteosarcoma and many losing their fight due to exhausting all treatment options. Alexis learned that there has been no new treatments and not enough research done. This drove Alexis to wanting to do something to help change this outcome. Alexis has dedicated her life to becoming an advocate in the fight against Osteosarcoma. She is involved in the wonderful organization MIB and worked on several initiatives with them. She has also used the power of her voice to raise awareness and help others who are currently in the fight. Alexis is currently in medical school at the University of Arizona with an end goal of becoming a pediatric oncologist.
