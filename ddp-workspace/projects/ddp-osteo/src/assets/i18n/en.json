Count Me In's Osteosarcoma (OS) Project is supported by a grant from the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Moonshot program and is part of the Participant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Network of research centers.

Because of regulatory restrictions, we are unable to share results with participants in New York and Canada. <br><br>The project is also partnering with Invitae in order to sequence and share information on germline DNA (or “normal” DNA) from saliva samples. During the project, participants will be able to decide if they would like to provide an additional saliva sample to learn more about their normal DNA and speak with a genetic counselor to understand these results. If a participant chooses not to participate in this process, their data will not be shared with Invitae.

Daniel had a smile that would light up a room, and all throughout treatment, he never quit smiling. While Daniel was on hospice, Theresa taught herself genomics and started doing research into osteosarcoma genetics. She was able to identify two drugs which corresponded to mutations in Daniel’s tumor and prolonged his life. Since Daniel’s death on August 28, 2016, she has continued her patient advocacy and genomics research and is the Principal Investigator of POWR, the Patient/parent Osteosarcoma genome-Wide Registry, believed to be one of the largest genomic and medical history registry of osteosarcoma data in the world. She has presented her research findings at numerous scientific conferences in the US and internationally, and has been invited to speak at a variety of forums. A TV long-story on Daniel and her work won the prestigious National 2018 June L. Biedler Award for TV journalism. In 2019, she started a closed Facebook group called the Osteosarcoma Information Group to provide scientific and medical information and explanations to osteosarcoma patients and their families. Today, there are well over 500 members and doctors and researchers are now joining the group as well. She is the founder and President of “Because of Daniel '', a charitable foundation dedicated to osteosarcoma research and clinical trials. She is also a co-founder and board member of the Osteosarcoma Collaborative, a charitable foundation dedicated to promoting collaboration in osteosarcoma.

She watched them bravely battle Osteosarcoma and many losing their fight due to exhausting all treatment options. Alexis learned that there has been no new treatments and not enough research done. This drove Alexis to wanting to do something to help change this outcome. Alexis has dedicated her life to becoming an advocate in the fight against Osteosarcoma. She is involved in the wonderful organization MIB and worked on several initiatives with them.
