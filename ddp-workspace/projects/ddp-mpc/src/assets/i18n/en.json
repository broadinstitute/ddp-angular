Cancer is not a single disease, and each tumor holds part of the puzzle. While prostate cancer is very common, few men have the ability to contribute their tumor samples and clinical data to cancer research, largely because they do not have a way of doing so.",

            "Research": {
                "Question": "2. What does it mean that you are conducting genomic and molecular research as part of this project?",
                "Section1": "This study involves genomic and molecular research to better define the genes and molecules that are important in esophageal and gastric/stomach cancer. Cancers occur when the molecules that control normal cell growth (such as genes and proteins) are altered. Genes are composed of DNA letters, which contain the instructions that tell the cells in our bodies how to grow and work. Changes in the DNA letters of genes that occur in tumor cells and normal tissues are called alterations. Several alterations that occur in certain types of cancers have already been identified and have led to the development of new drugs that specifically target those alterations. However, the vast majority of tumors from patients have not been studied, which means there is a tremendous amount of information about the molecular basis of cancer that is still left to be discovered. Our goal is to discover more alterations involved in cancer, and to better understand those that have been previously described. We think this information could lead to the development of additional cancer therapies and cures.",
                "Section2": "In order to define these gene alterations in your cancer, we will use a technology called DNA sequencing. Sequencing is a way of reading the DNA letters of your genes to identify alterations in genes that may contribute to the behavior of cells. Some changes in genes occur only in cancer cells. Others occur in normal cells as well, in the genes that may have been passed from parent to child. This research study will examine both kinds of genes."

            "WhyBoth": {
                "Question": "3. Why are you studying both esophageal and gastric/stomach cancer?",
                "Section1": "In the United States, the most common anatomic location where we see esophageal and gastric/stomach cancer is where the stomach and esophagus meet (often referred to as the gastroesophageal junction or GE Junction). In addition to cancers that arise at this junction, cancers that start in the esophagus may spread to the stomach, and cancers that start in the stomach may spread to the esophagus. Additionally, recent scientific studies indicate that these cancers are strikingly similar on the molecular level. By studying these cancers together we can further compare and contrast them to determine to what extent they have distinct biologic and clinical features."
