However, enrollment space is limited and will be filled on a first-come, first served basis. If you enroll, you will receive a home self-testing kit within approximately one week of joining the study. The home test kit will contain a virology test kit (nasal swab) and an antibody test kit (finger prick), with instructions on how to collect and return your samples to our lab for testing. The nasal swab of the front of your nose tests if you have COVID-19 right now. The finger prick tests if you have antibodies to COVID-19 (meaning that you were exposed to the virus in the past). If you agree to be re-tested, and are eligible for the longer study, we will send you kits to repeat these tests every month for 5 additional months."
