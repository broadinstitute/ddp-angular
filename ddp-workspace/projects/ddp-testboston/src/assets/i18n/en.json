However, enrollment space is limited and will be filled on a first-come, first served basis. If you enroll, you will receive a home-testing kit containing two tests within approximately one week of joining the study. The home test kit will contain a virology test kit (nasal swab) and an antibody test kit (finger prick), with instructions on how to collect and return your samples to our lab for testing. The nasal swab detects if you have active COVID-19. The finger prick tests if you have antibodies to COVID-19 (meaning that you had the virus in the past). If you also agree to join the longitudinal study, we will send you kits to repeat these tests every month for 5 additional months."
