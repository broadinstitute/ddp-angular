Susie had surgery at MD Anderson Cancer Center and enrolled in a Phase 2 Clinical Trial that has become standard of care. After five years without recurrence, they took advantage of an expat opportunity in Cambridge, UK. Upon returning to Austin, Susie’s brain cancer recurred as a Secondary Glioblastoma. Susie’s dream in 1999 was for her kids to know her, which she exceeded helping them grow-up, celebrating high school graduations and now attending university.",

                    "Question": "1. What is the goal of this project?",
                    "Section1": "Today, very few patients have the ability to contribute their tumor samples and clinical data to cancer research, largely because they do not have a way of doing so. We believe everyone should have the opportunity to contribute to research, especially now that the combination of genome sequencing and internet-based communication has made it easier to give people that opportunity.",
                    "Section2": "This project will connect brain cancer patients around the United States and Canada with scientists and researchers using cutting-edge technology to study cancer's genetic and molecular causes. Cancer is not a single disease, and each tumor holds part of the puzzle.",
                    "Section3": "One of the goals of our studies is to help us better understand the genomic landscape of brain cancer. By discovering the genes and the variants that drive this disease and sharing this data, we hope insights can be gained to develop more effective therapies."

                "GenomicResearch": {
                    "Question": "2. What are the genomic and molecular research aspects of this project?",
                    "Section1": "This study involves genomic and molecular research to better define the genes and molecules that are important in brain cancer. Cancers occur when the molecules that control normal cell growth (such as genes and proteins) are altered. Genes are composed of DNA letters, which contain the instructions that tell the cells in our bodies how to grow and work. Changes in the DNA letters of genes that occur in tumor cells and normal tissues are called alterations. Several alterations that occur in certain types of cancers have already been identified as oncogenes, genes that have the potential to cause cancer, and have led to the development of new drugs that specifically target those alterations.",
                    "Section2": "However, the vast majority of tumors from patients have not been studied, which means there is a tremendous amount of information about the molecular basis of cancer that is still left to be discovered. Our goal is to discover more alterations involved in cancer, and to better understand those that have been previously described. We think this information could lead to the development of more effective cancer therapies.",
                    "Section3": "In order to define these gene alterations in brain cancers, we will use a technology called DNA sequencing. Sequencing is a way of reading the DNA letters of your genes to identify alterations in genes that may contribute to the behavior of cells. Some changes in genes occur only in cancer cells. Others occur in normal cells as well, in the genes that may have been passed from parent to child. This research study will examine both kinds of genes."

Once we create the history, we send requests out directly to the pathology departments where the tissue is housed. We ask that pathology departments send the samples to us in the form of unstained slides or blocks, and that they do not exhaust the sample in order to send us a portion.
