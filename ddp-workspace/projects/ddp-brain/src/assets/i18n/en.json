Cancers occur when the molecules that control normal cell growth (such as genes and proteins) are altered. Genes are composed of DNA letters, which contain the instructions that tell the cells in our bodies how to grow and work. Changes in the DNA letters of genes that occur in tumor cells and normal tissues are called alterations. Several alterations that occur in certain types of cancers have already been identified as oncogenes, genes that have the potential to cause cancer, and have led to the development of new drugs that specifically target those alterations.",
                            "However, the vast majority of tumors from patients have not been studied, which means there is a tremendous amount of information about the molecular basis of cancer that is still left to be discovered. Our goal is to discover more alterations involved in cancer, and to better understand those that have been previously described. We think this information could lead to the development of more effective cancer therapies.",
                            "In order to define these gene alterations in brain tumors, we will use a technology called DNA sequencing. Sequencing is a way of reading the DNA letters of your genes to identify alterations in genes that may contribute to the behavior of cells. Some changes in genes occur only in cancer cells. Others occur in normal cells as well, in the genes that may have been passed from parent to child. This research study will examine both kinds of genes."
